## Camille Juigné

I am a PhD student in bioinformatics at both **INRAE** and **IRISA**, supervised by **Florence Gondret** and **[Emmanuelle Becker](https://www-dyliss.irisa.fr/team-members/emmanuelle-becker/)**.

My research subject concerns the integration and analysis of heterogeneous biological data modelled with multiplex graphs applied to understand and predict variations in feeding efficiency. The objective is to **identify networks of molecules to explain an animal phenotype**, by considering different levels of organization of the living, using statistics and then by analyzing multilayer graphs. This second approach has the advantage of adopting a **holistic view on biological organization** by integrating different omic levels. This allows to get closer to reality by considering things as a whole and linked together. 

In this case of application, understanding the valorization of food resources by the animal will lead to a saving of resources and a reduction of discharges and effluents into the environment.

-  *may-oct 2019* : Intership
"Integration and formal analysis of the ubyquitin interaction network" co-supervized by Emmanuelle Becker, Gwenaël Rabut and Olivier Dameron

*Protein–protein interactions are essential to ensure biologic processes, analysing them and considering the cells as an inner system provide us to understand these related processes.The biggest challenge is to discover all these interactions. Until recently, large scale sieve have been made using different methods. However, each one of these methods has its flaws and introduce detection bias. That is why we have been studying new methods to detect these interactions and that we have been extracting all the possible protein-protein interactions of the ubiquitine system in order to analyse them using formal methods.
**The ubiquitin system governs the stability, activity and abundance of proteins in cells. Aberrations in the ubiquitin system may be linked to multiple pathologies and are particularly involved in human diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.***
