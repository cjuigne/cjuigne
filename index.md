## Camille Juigné

I am a PhD student in bioinformatics at both **INRAE** and **IRISA**, supervised by **Florence Gondret** and **Emmanuelle Becker**.

My research subject concerns the integration and analysis of heterogeneous biological data modelled with multiplex graphs applied to understand and predict variations in feeding efficiency. The objective is to **identify networks of molecules to explain an animal phenotype**, by considering different levels of organization of the living, using statistics and then by analyzing multilayer graphs. This second approach has the advantage of adopting a **holistic view on biological organization** by integrating different omic levels. This allows to get closer to reality by considering things as a whole and linked together. 

In this case of application, understanding the valorization of food resources by the animal will lead to a saving of resources and a reduction of discharges and effluents into the environment.
